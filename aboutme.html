        <h3 class=amText> Career Goals </h3>
        <p class=amPara>
            Space is a wonderful, vast, and dark expanse. Full of many diffrent wonders that still perplex many people to this day. 
            The world is one of those things to still to this day people do not understand. 
            I hope in the future to be in the field of science. 
            I enjoy math and physics and hope to become a theoretical physicist or astronomer. 
            Ever since I was young, I have always enjoyed science and math. 
            I have alwyas had a passion for space, reading things and learning about how the world works.
            I enjoy every aspect of science from how the Earth works to how things in the cosmos function to electricty and even geology and rocks.

        <h3 class=amText> More about me </h3>
        <p class=amPara>
            I enjoy learning about new things that interest me and make me question why I am learning it and what it means to gain the knowledge.
            When it comes to math or science, I usually excell in these topics because I find myself out of class still learning about these things and questioning what they mean and do.
            I work as hard as I can for the topics I love and alwyas make sure to go above and beyond while not trying too much and limiting myself to do what I think is best.
            I have been told by many of my peers and teachers about how hard I work on the things I love and enjoy learning about.

        <h3 class=amText> Experiences </h3>
        <p class=amPara> 
            I have learned to be smart about the decisions I make before taking them. 
            To read all possible ways and outcomes of a situation before approaching it and taking the time to learn in the process.
            I love to interact with those who have the same ideas and even if I meet someone with oppisite ideas I always hear both sides of the story before making my decision on what I believe.
            Talking with people and making friends is something I am proud of doing and working well with others is a big key role in my life.

        <p class=amPara>
            I enjoy learning about how things work, wether that be as simple as a motor or as big as super novas or galaxies.
            I open my heart to those around me and share my thoughts with pride.
            I make sure to put time and dedication into what I love and get it finished with the best of my abilities.
