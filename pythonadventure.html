        <h3>
            Since the start of this project, many of my issues came from balancing time wise and also 
            having to overcome some of the struggles of python. For instance when it was my first time 
            trying to overcome python, it was tough. Everything had to be very specific and ne symbol could 
            cost me my enttire project. But eventually, I learned and got through it. It was much easier than Java 
            in my opinion because it was quick and fast and not many issues occured when coding it. A lot of the main 
            issues were human error, like forgetting to put a colon somewhere or just all around getting lost in my 
            story because I wasn't really organized. But once these challenges were overcome it was a
            lot of fun to create and code this story. I feel a lot more comforabtle with python and really
            apprieciate its simplicity.
